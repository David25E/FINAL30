# FINAL-30-Project

This project is the culminating project for my Grade 10 Computer Technology course. I initially completed a FINAL30 proposal assignment that listed my research for the  idea, materials, plan of the last month, and my overall inspiration.

## My Idea
My idea is a Tackle Box Fish Finder/Depth Sonar. It is a waterproof tackle box that will be consisted of one half being the electronic component while the other half will be storage for lures and tackle. The electronic half will be the UBMP4 board, a 20x4 LCD Display, JSN SR04T V3.0 sensor module, a water flow sensor, and a portable charger/battery. On the bottom right side of the container I will drill a hole for the distance sensor cable and water flow sensor to be placed outside, which will be sealed off with silicon.

### What This Repository will be About
- The code that I have used and wrote
- The libraries I have used
- A file as my diary of the journey

#### What my Diary Will Consist of
- What I have learned
- My difficulties
- My adaptations/changes in plans
- My decisions/thinking process
- Pictures of the progress, challenges, and journey

As a begineer, you will be able to distinguish my mistakes and what I should have done instead. Programming is all about thinking outside of the box with unexplainable logic. You must be creative, curious, willing to try, and challenged. Don't fear of being embarrased or failing. Ultimately, I may not finish my project in time.
